This repository was created by Dongwoo Kang and Jihoo Kim, for COM S 327 Spring 2020 Project part2

I made a rules for Tableau to Tableau and Foundation. Also, I made the showing data that can be human readable part. 
Jihoo part============================================================

int moveTableau(char** dataTotal,char a, char b, int* dataSize)

-find the card from the tableau and move it. Delete the card from the data when the card is moving. Can move multiple card

int getInteger(char num)

-get the integer using char num

int findIndex(char a)

-find the index using char a

int checkCard(char** dataTotal, char a, int* dataSize)

-check the card if it can move with the higher card in tableau

int saveTableau(char** dataTotal,int* dataSize,char a,char num,char shape, int check)

save the card to tableau when it moved to tableau

int saveFoundation(char** dataTotal,int* dataSize,char num,char shape)

save the card to foundation when it moved to foundation

void showData(char** data,int* dataSize)

show the data which is part for human readable

Dongwoo Kang part==========================================================

<readFile.c part>

readFile.h 
- I make a header file of the previous project file.

char getTurns() 
- Return the turn value of the game like 1 or 3.

char getLimits()
- Return the number of limit of this game 

int getStockSize()
- return the size of stock which save stock data from infile.txt

<move.c part>

int StockToWaste(char c, char c2, char** data) 
- this method get stock data from readFile.h and modify the stock data.
when user move a card from stock to waste according to turn, it modify the stock data.
when user reverse waste card, it can reverse too by getting 'r' variable. 

int WasteToFoundationOrTableau(char c1, char c2, char** data) 
- its c1 is 'w' and its c2 is a index of tableau. 
When user want to move a card from waste to foundation, they use this method. 
It prints out of error message if a moved card doesn't match on color or number.

void printTableau(char** data, int* dataSize)
- return the data of Tableau as human readiable formmationg.


Together =============================

main method

-implements those above methods to show right output information.

int callRead()

-calling the part1 part

void executeMove(char** dataTotal, int* dataSize)

-execute the move function
